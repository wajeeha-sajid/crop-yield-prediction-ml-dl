# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project explores crop yield forecasting using traditional ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning models (CNN, LSTM). The models are evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation and common error metrics on agricultural data.

## 📂 Files Included
